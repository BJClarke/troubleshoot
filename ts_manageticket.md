# Troubleshooting for managing support tickets
{: #SupportTickets}

{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}} ticket problems might include an inability to manage  {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} support tickets.
{:shortdesc}

## Linked accounts cannot add or edit support tickets
{: #ts_service_broker}

If you have a linked account, you might not be able to add or edit {{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} support tickets.
{:shortdesc}

You are unable to create or edit support tickets in {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}.
{: tsSymptoms}

General problems with accessing and managing support tickets, if you have a linked account, could be caused by lack of more granular account settings in the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} customer portal. Because there are more granular permissions that must be configured on accounts that were created in the customer portal, you might not be able to add or edit support tickets.
{: tsCauses}

To correct the problem, contact your customer portal account administrator to set the proper access on your account. The customer portal account administrator can correct the problem using the following steps:

1. From the customer portal **Account** menu, select **Users**.
2. Select the user from the list.
3. From **Portal Permissions** on the user profile, select the **Support** tab and click to provide the user with proper permissions to view, add, and edit support tickets.
